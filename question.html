        Neumorphism focuses on creating a clean, soft, and tactile feel. It relies on background colors, highlights, and shadows to give a sense of depth. For example, buttons or cards in Neumorphic designs appear "pressed in" or "pushed out," which makes them visually appealing.

If you'd like to incorporate Neumorphism into your to-do app, here's how we can style it:

Background: Use a soft, neutral background color (like #e0e0e0 or light gray).
Input Fields and Buttons: Add a slight shadow to make them appear raised.
Shadows: Use two shadows—one light (for the highlight) and one dark (for the shadow)—to create the effect.
